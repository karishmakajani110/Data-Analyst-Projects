# BMI Calculator (Python)

## Project Overview
This project is a Python program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input and categorizes the result into standard BMI ranges. The project focuses on applying basic Python programming concepts such as input handling, calculations, and conditional logic.

---

## Objective
- Practice handling user input in Python  
- Perform mathematical calculations  
- Apply conditional logic to classify calculated values  

---

## Tools
- Python  

---

## How the Program Works
The script performs the following steps:

- Prompts the user to enter their name, weight (in pounds), and height (in inches)  
- Calculates BMI using the standard BMI formula  
- Displays the calculated BMI value along with the corresponding category  

---

## BMI Categories
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5  
- Normal weight: 18.5 – 24.9  
- Overweight: 25 – 29.9  
- Obese: 30 – 34.9  
- Severely Obese: 35 – 39.9  
- Morbidly Obese: BMI ≥ 40

## Usage
1. Run the Python script  
2. Enter the required values when prompted  
3. View the calculated BMI and category in the output
