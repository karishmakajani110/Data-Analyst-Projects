# BMI Calculator (Python)

This project is a simple Python program that calculates Body Mass Index (BMI) based on user input and classifies the result into standard health categories.

## Objective
To demonstrate Python fundamentals such as user input handling, mathematical calculations, and conditional logic.

## How It Works
- Prompts the user to enter name, weight (in pounds), and height (in inches)
- Calculates BMI using the standard formula
- Displays BMI value and corresponding health category

## BMI Categories
- Underweight: BMI < 18.5
- Normal weight: 18.5 – 24.9
- Overweight: 25 – 29.9
- Obese: 30 – 34.9
- Severely Obese: 35 – 39.9
- Morbidly Obese: BMI ≥ 40

## Tools
- Python

## Usage
1. Run the script.
2. Enter your name, weight, and height when prompted.
3. View your BMI and health classification in the output.

## Notes
This project focuses on demonstrating core Python programming concepts rather than medical accuracy.
