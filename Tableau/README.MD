# Airbnb Data Analysis & Dashboard using Tableau

## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data using Tableau to understand pricing trends,
revenue patterns, and listing distribution across neighborhoods and property attributes.

Public Airbnb data for Seattle was sourced from Kaggle and combined across multiple CSV
files to create an interactive dashboard for exploratory and business-focused analysis.

## Tools & Technologies
- Tableau
- Data Joins
- Calculated Fields
- Filters & Parameters

## Data Source
- Public Airbnb Seattle dataset (Kaggle)
  https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/airbnb/seattle

## Data Preparation & Transformation
The following data preparation steps were performed in Tableau:
- Joined multiple CSV files using inner joins
- Validated join keys and removed unmatched records
- Created calculated fields for pricing and revenue metrics
- Filtered and structured data for visualization by location, time, and property attributes

## Analysis Performed
The dashboard includes analysis of:
- Average price by zipcode
- Price distribution across neighborhoods (map view)
- Revenue trends over time
- Average price by number of bedrooms
- Listing distribution by bedroom count

## Dashboard Output
An interactive Tableau dashboard was created to allow users to explore Airbnb pricing and
revenue trends across zipcodes, bedroom categories, and time periods.

## Key Insight
The analysis shows that listing prices vary significantly by zipcode and number of bedrooms,
with higher bedroom counts and specific locations commanding higher average prices.

## Outcome
This project demonstrates Tableau skills in data blending, visual storytelling, and
exploratory analysis to uncover pricing and revenue trends in short-term rental data.
