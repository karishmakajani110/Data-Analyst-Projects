# Time-Series Data Analysis & Trend Evaluation (SQL)

## Project Overview
This project analyzes a public time-series dataset using SQL to examine trends and changes over time across countries and regions. The primary focus was on practicing data exploration, aggregation, and comparison using time-based data.

The analysis was performed using Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS) on a structured dataset containing approximately 85,000 records.

---

## Objective
- Explore time-based data using SQL  
- Apply aggregations and window functions to compare trends across regions  
- Practice organizing multi-step SQL queries for analysis  

---

## Tools & Technologies
- SQL  
- Microsoft SQL Server (SSMS)  
- Common Table Expressions (CTEs)  
- Temporary Tables  
- Views  
- Window Functions (PARTITION BY)  

---

## Data Source
Public time-series dataset from *Our World in Data* related to COVID-19 reporting:  
https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths  

**Date Range:** January 28, 2020 – April 30, 2021

---

## Data Preparation & Transformation
The following SQL techniques were used during analysis:

- Created CTEs to organize multi-step analytical queries  
- Used temporary tables and views to store intermediate results  
- Applied window functions (PARTITION BY) for regional and population-based comparisons  
- Performed aggregations and joins across multiple tables  

---

## Analysis Performed
The analysis included structured comparisons such as:

- Total cases compared to total deaths  
- Infection counts relative to population size  
- Countries with higher infection rates relative to population  
- Countries and continents compared by death counts  
- Vaccination totals compared to population  

---

## Outcome
This project demonstrates practical SQL skills for working with time-based datasets, including data exploration, aggregation, joins, and window functions. The focus is on structuring queries and analyzing trends over time using a public dataset.
